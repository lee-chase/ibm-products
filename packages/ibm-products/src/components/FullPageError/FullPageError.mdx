## Overview

Display a full-page error when the requested page is unavailable to the user.
This is typically caused by issues with the requested URL or access permissions.
Errors caused by server connectivity issues are not covered in this guideline.\
The `UIShell` and `Breadcrumbs` (if applicable) should be implemented at the product
level.

## Example usage

{/* TODO: One example per designed use case. */}

### Default

The default error page can be used for full-page errors that are not 403 or 404
errors, and not caused by server connectivity issues.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.fullPageError} />
</Canvas>

### 403 variant

Display an Access Denied (403) error message when the user lacks permission to
access the page or data, or when login is required.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.fullPageError403} />
</Canvas>

### 404 variant

Show a Page Not Found (404) error message when the requested page cannot be
located on the server, typically due to outdated bookmarks, mistyped URLs, or
broken links.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.fullPageError404} />
</Canvas>
