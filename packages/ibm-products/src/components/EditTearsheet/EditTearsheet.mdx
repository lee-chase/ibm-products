## Overview

When to use

- The create flow happened in a tear sheet.
- A subset of the related item will be edited.
- You want to keep the user in context instead of taking the user to a new page.
- The amount of content is too much for a modal or narrow tear sheet.
- The content is too complex for a modal or narrow tear sheet.
- If the space to edit in the original location is too restricted (i.e. in a
  narrow side panel), a tear sheet can provide more area to work.

When not to use

- Do not use when the edit actions are few/simple - consider using a modal
  instead.

Anatomy of EditTearsheet

<img src={editTearsheetAnatomy} />

1. **Header**: The header can include title, description, labels, and tabs. Must
   include “Edit” in the title.

2. **Main content area**: This area includes the editable content.

3. **Navigation buttons**: In most cases, the navigation buttons are limited to
   primary and secondary buttons (“Save” and “Cancel”). If the edit flow
   requires steps (not common), the Next/previous buttons serve as the primary
   and secondary buttons until the last step, where the primary button is “Save”
   (Cancel is the ghost button in this case).

4. **Influencer (optional)**: A left side panel that can be used, for example,
   as a menu, progress indicator, or filter. Alternatively, a right side panel
   can be used for a Summary (of changes).

5. **Background overlay**: An overlay which appears same as in modals

## Example usage

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(EditTearsheet.displayName, 'multi-form-tearsheet')} />
</Canvas>

This is used when you have one section per step. This can be created by passing
in the overall `<EditTearsheet />` component and the `<EditTearsheetForm />`
component with form items as children:

```jsx
<EditTearsheet {...props}>
  <EditTearsheetForm
    title="Required title"
    subtitle="Optional subtitle"
    description="Optional description"
    onNext={() => {
      'Optional function';
    }}
  >
    <TextInput
      id="test-1"
      invalidText="A valid value is required"
      labelText="Topic name"
      placeholder="Enter topic name"
    />
  </EditTearsheetForm>
</EditTearsheet>
```

## Using custom components

It is possible to use custom components that return `EditTearsheetForm`s in
order to help reduce the amount of logic in the component that contains the main
`EditTearsheet`. _It is required that each child of the `EditTearsheet` either
be a custom step or a `EditTearsheetForm`_. An example of this could look like
the following:

```jsx
const CreateFormCustom = ({ subtitle, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <EditTearsheetForm {...rest} subtitle={subtitle} title="Form 1">
      form content here
    </EditTearsheetForm>
  );
};

const CreateComponent = () => {
  return (
    <EditTearsheet {...EditTearsheetProps}>
      <CreateFormCustom subtitle="Custom form subtitle" />
      <EditTearsheetForm
        title="Topic name"
        fieldsetLegendText="Topic information"
        subtitle="This is the unique name used to recognize your topic"
        description="It will also be used by your producers and consumers as part of the
        connection information, so make it something easy to recognize."
      >
        Content for second form
      </EditTearsheetForm>
    </EditTearsheet>
  );
};
```

## Class names

Additionally, to get the preferred styling when including your own children as
sections, you can utilize the below included class names.

| Class name                                            | Element     | Features                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#{$pkg-prefix}--create-tearsheet__form--title`       | title       | `productive-heading-04` & `margin-bottom` of `$spacing-05` |
| `#{$pkg-prefix}--create-tearsheet__form--subtitle`    | subtitle    | `productive-heading-01` & `margin-bottom` of `$spacing-03` |
| `#{$pkg-prefix}--create-tearsheet__form--description` | description | `body-long-01` & `margin-bottom` of `$spacing-06`          |
| `#{$pkg-prefix}--create-tearsheet__form--fieldset`    | fieldset    | `margin-bottom` of `$spacing-05` to all children elements  |
