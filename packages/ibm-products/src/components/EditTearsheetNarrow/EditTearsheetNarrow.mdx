## Overview

### When to use

- The original create flow was in a narrow tear sheet.
- There are enough edits to require scrolling.
- The content is more complex than what is allowed in a modal.

### When not to use

- The task is too small to warrant the tear sheet (i.e., only one field needs to
  be edited) - use inline edit or a modal instead.
- The user needs to interact with, compare, or have full view of the rest of the
  screen’s content.
- Input is required before a user can proceed - use a modal instead.
- If there is a large amount of editable content or complex/multi -step
  interactions needed - use a large tear sheet or side panel instead.

   Always include “Edit” in the title.

2. **Main content area**: This area includes the editable content.

   “Cancel”.
